# Classification of an image using AI

***We have used Tensorflow for the classification of an image. We are checking here whether the pit remediation is completed in an image or not.***

## Steps to follow:-

#### _Step 1: Data Collection_

•	Gather a diverse set of images for both completed and incomplete pit remediation scenarios.

•	Label the images accurately as completed or incomplete.

#### _Step 2: Data Preprocessing_
•	Annotation: If relevant features in the images need highlighting, annotate them using tools like LabelImg or Roboflow.

•	Normalization: Resize the images to a uniform dimension (e.g., 224x224) for consistency.

•	Augmentation: Apply transformations such as rotation, flipping, or brightness adjustments to expand your dataset and improve model robustness.

#### _Step 3: Model Selection_
•	Pretrained Models: Use pretrained CNN models like ResNet, EfficientNet, or MobileNet as a starting point.

•	Custom Model: If the dataset is sufficiently large, consider designing a CNN from scratch.

#### _Step 4: Model Training_
•	Frameworks: Use TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras for implementation.

•	Split Data: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70%-20%-10%).

•	Optimizer and Loss Function: Use an optimizer like Adam and a loss function like binary cross-entropy.

•	Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the model parameters based on validation performance.

#### _Step 5: Evaluation_
•	Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

•	Analyze misclassifications to identify areas for improvement.

#### _Step 6: Deployment_
•	Integrate the trained model into your application or monitoring system.

•	Use cloud services or edge devices depending on the deployment needs.
